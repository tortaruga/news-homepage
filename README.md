## Overview

I have hated every second of this challenge. I will find the one responsible for the creation of that monstruos abomination that is CSS grids and I will have my revenge. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

I have learned that there is a rift between me and grids that will never be closed. I hate grids with all of my might. I hate it, and fear it, and it senses it, and like a sadistic wolf it toys with me before ripping me apart with its fangs. 
It's so easy and straightforward in theory! There's nothing to it! It's crystal clear! I understand all of it!
And then the moment comes to actually use it and the layout that gets displayed is never the one I'm trying to get. It's like the mechanics of this devilish tool keep morphing and changing to always keep me guessing. I swear it does it on purpose.

I have also learned that the dialog tag does whatever the dialog tags wants to do. There is no taming her, confining her into your own vision of a perfect webpage, placing her where you'd like, predicting her behaviorâ€”no. She will not bow to your petty requests. She will stand proud and majestic in the middle of the page whether you want her on the right side or not. She will be opened even though she logically shouldn't be yet. She will refuse to let you stile the backdrop in a straightforward, no-fuss way. You're going to have to do everything manually with JS. 
Because she belongs to the wild jungles, and the wild jungles will strangle you like vicious vines for no other reason than the whimsical darkness that resides in their deep green hearts.

(display:flex makes the dialog show even with no open property, to place the damned thing on the right wrap it in a div, if the parent is flexed the height will categorically refuse to take up the 100vh, the backdrop element works only if the dialog is a modal, but then for whatever reason the styling stops working I'm having so much fun can you tell i think i'm not smart enough for this i just want to sleep in the ocean)


### Continued development

Grids.

The whola ARIA thing confuses me, I have to study it more. I'm not sure whether I should have used it in this project. I tried using semantic tags wherever possible, so I thought the role was already established, and the divs I used were only for styling purposes so I think they don't require any special additional labeling?
